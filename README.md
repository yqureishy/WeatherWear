* **Purpose of the app:** <br/><br/>
Have you ever looked at a weather app, checked the temperature and then went outside only to realize you aren't wearing enough layers? 
Has it ever happened to you that your household thermostat is set to 75°F while the outside temperature is 41°F, and you tell yourself it's not that cold? But when you step outside it doesn't really feel like 41°F because your body temperature has been accustomed to the indoor temperature, so you tell yourself a sweater will do just fine for your walk. But then 10 minutes into your walk all of a sudden you realize you had underestimated the temperature, and you're now just standing in one spot shivering. <br><b>WeatherWear helps solve that issue!</b>

   WeatherWear is your go-to weather app that SHOWS you what to wear based on the 'feels-like' temperature for any city across the world! With more than 15 clothing options and 5 temperature ranges WeatherWear helps you decide what to wear!
